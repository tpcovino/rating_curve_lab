# rating_curve_lab

In this lab we will analyze rating curve data. A rating curve is a relationship between stage (depth of water) and discharge (flow). In natural rivers these relationships tend to change over time as the geomorphology of the river channel changes. When this happens the rating curve needs to be updated.
